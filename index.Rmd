Hey!

I'm Matteo Larrode, Volunteer Data Scientist at [L'Equipage Solidaire](https://delivraide.org), a French non-profit that delivers food and hygenic supplies to students in need at their home, for free. I believe that data can be a powerful tool for positive change, and I am committed to using my skills to help make a difference. I use a variety of tools including Tableau and RShiny to reach this objective, and also enjoy building side projects like this [shiny app mapping election results in India](https://matteolarrode.shinyapps.io/mapelectionsindia/?_ga=2.169367457.1295429016.1680480062-1674700938.1679507361), in collaboration with Emmanuel Teitelbaum, PhD.

Having lived in France, London, and Washington D.C., and having worked as a Research Assistant with Dr. Laila Sorurbakhsh, I've had the chance to meet wonderful friends and mentors, from all around the world. Outside of work and academia, I like to build bikes, play football, climb, and surf! 

Thank you for visiting my website, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work.
