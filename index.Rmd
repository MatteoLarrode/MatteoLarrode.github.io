Hey!

I'm Matteo Larrode, Volunteer Data Scientist at [L'Equipage Solidaire](https://delivraide.org). 


I study Politics, Economics and Philosophy at University College London (UCL) with a specialization in Social Data Science. I am passionate about research and absolutely adore the mix of quantitative methods and humanities subjects that my degree has to offer. I had the opportunity to work with natural language processing, spatial analysis, regression and even time-series analysis. 
  
  
Currently in a year abroad in  Washington DC, at the George Washington University. I am taking classes of data mining, data vizualization and data analytics for International Relations. I work with Laila Sorurbakhsh, PhD, on a quantitative study of interest group behaviour in the face of policy risk. I am also developing a RShiny app to build an interactive map of Indian election results, in collaboration with Emmanuel Teitelbaum, PhD.


Outside of work I like to build bikes, play football, climb, and surf!
